# Distributed File Orchestration and Synchronization  

## File Transfer Server-Client Application  

This project is a **multi-client file transfer system** implemented using **Python and TCP sockets**. It allows users to **authenticate, upload, download, preview, delete, and list files** on a remote server. The system ensures that each user can log in from only **one session at a time**.

## üöÄ Features  

‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access the system.  

‚úÖ **File Operations**: Supports listing, uploading, downloading, previewing, and deleting files.  

‚úÖ **Thread-Safe Multi-Client Support**: Uses a **thread pool** to handle multiple clients efficiently.  

‚úÖ **Chunked File Transfers**: Supports large file uploads/downloads in **chunks** to handle network constraints.  

‚úÖ **Session Control**: Prevents **multiple logins** from the same user.

## üõ† How to Run
1Ô∏è‚É£ Running on the Same Machine (Localhost)
‚û§ Start the Server
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python server.py
```
The server will start listening on port 33000 for incoming connections.

‚û§ Start the Client
Open another terminal on the same machine and run:

```bash
python client.py
```
The client will prompt for a username and password to authenticate.
Once authenticated, users can choose various file operations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Running on Different Machines (Server-Client Mode)
‚û§ Step 1: Start the Server on the Server Machine
On the server system, open a terminal and run:

```bash
python server.py
```
The server will start listening on port 33000 for incoming connections.

‚û§ Step 2: Configure the Client
On the client system, open client.py in a text editor and uncomment line 7:

#server_address = input("enter ip address of serv ")

When running the client, enter the IP address of the server machine when prompted.

‚û§ Step 3: Start the Client
Now, on the client system, open a terminal and run:

```bash
python client.py
```
Enter the server's IP address when prompted, then proceed with authentication.
